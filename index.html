      <p>At CTI, I develope open source software and open government-owned platforms. Our goal is to give users the
        tools they need without restrictions or red-tape holding them back. We use Agile development methods and modern
        frameworks to build our software. I build desktop and web applications to solve a variety of complex
        domain-specific problems.</p>

      <p>At the University of Wisconsin, I developed websites and applications to help support marketing initiatives. My
        roles and responsibilites included coordinating with clients to understand their vision, researching tools and
        frameworks to meet their needs, and implementing websites or software. In order to create a project, I worked
        alongside UI/UX designers whom provided layouts and mockups as guidelines. We used Agile-like development
        methods including a continuous release cycle with feedback from the client.</p>

      <p>As a freelancer, I helped people around the city in Madison. As a new programmer, I was looking for
        opportunities in web development wherever I could find them. This led me to a series of unique projects
        including e-commerce website development, automated sports advertisements for a local hockey team (on a
        Raspberry Pi in their stadium), and websites for small businesses. </p>

    <p>I've been building websites and web applications for years now. I started out as a hobbyist but it turned into a
      real career for me over time. I was originally drawn to Ruby on Rails because it had an easy to understand MVC
      framework. Since then, I've dabbled in Django, Node.JS, React, Angular, ASP.Net and more.</p>

    <p>In addition to web development, I enjoy game development with Unity in C#, which has required learning Blender
      for 3D modeling and animation.</p>

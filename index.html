          <p class="icon-description">I like Ruby on Rails for web development. I've used it for CRM's and basic CMS's. I also like to use Ruby as a back-end for most of my projects. The Ruby MVC is simple, efficient, and fun! I've built community used and privately owned Gems.</p>

          <p class="icon-description">React JS and I go together like water and 10,000 year old oil... I actually really like React JS, but it does have its drawbacks. Unlike a lot of JS frameworks, it seems to lend itself <i>strongly</i> to single-page JS applications. I happen to like the syntax and the Redux state manager, but I don't think I like the way they absorb my applications. The more complexity I need, the more I rely on React to get the job done.</p>

        <div class="slider hidden up grid two-col">
          <div class="icon hover down" id="vue-icon"></div>
          <p class="icon-description">As you could probably tell, I'm a bigger fan of Vue JS. Maybe thats my Ruby on Rails affiliation showing, but I find Vue much more convenient for UI. After all, I JS is primarily a way of keeping your users on the page. So, I like using Vue because it helps me limit the number of redirects while still animated and requesting data for the user.</p>

        <div class="slider hidden up grid two-col">
          <div class="icon hover down reverse" id="python-icon"></div>
          <p class="icon-description">Call me crazy, but I love Python and I've never used Django. I'll admit, I'm intimidated by most of the online tutorials. Python always attracts the harshest one-liners. Maybe it's just me, but I like expanded self-descriptive code. I usually use Python for my Coursera work in traditional Computer Science. Graphs, Binary Trees, Linked Lists, etc. Building classes and the necessary methods are much faster than in languages like C++.</p>

				<h1>about this website</h1>
				<p>So, why build a webpage?</p>
				<p>I'm mostly here to blog my posts on Reddit. I think an archive of my comments would make it much faster for
					me to push out responses and allow others to curate my responses over time. Essentially, this is a repo of the
					assumptions and responses I have to other's requests.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions, reach out to <a href="mailto:sean.sys.dev@gmail.com">sean.sys.dev@gmail.com</a>
					(that "sys" comes from my kernel staging email address for commits. It's not because I do system dev)</p>

				<h2>about me</h2>
				<p>Web dev for 4 years. I primarily work with Ruby on Rails, but via running virtual hosts through Apache so I'm
					vaguely confident in Apache configurations. I've been a Jack of All and Master of None for most of my time as
					a developer. I'm not exactly an expert in any one language, but I have an emphasis in web development with a
					decent heap of experience with JavaScript frontend languages.</p>

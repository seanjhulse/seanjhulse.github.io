				<h1>What's HTTP?</h1>
				<p>A user enters /r/learnprogramming with this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/anr3db/doing_my_first_fullstack_project_and_i_dont_even/efvhjj2/?context=3" target="_blank">POST</a>. I haphazardly and hand-wavingly explained HTTP requests along with the fundamentals of Ruby on Rails. It was one of those moments where I felt compelled to explain the world to someone. I remembered wishing someone told me all of that. I got a lot of attention for it, but I think it was misplaced. I was so hand-wavy that I feel I gave them a false sense of understanding.</p>
				<p>So let me try again...</p>
				<h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
				<p>HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. If we are willing to get into the weeds a little bit, "hypertext" means "text displayed on a screen", which makes HTTP a lot more logical, right? It's the protocol for transferring text from screen A to a screen B. From a web developer's standpoint, HTTP is only 4 functions: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. We don't <i>really</i> care how it happens. If you're really interested, just read Wikipedia and the subsequent details on the official RFC documentation. 99% of web development is just making 4 requests.
				<p>We want to GET things, we want to POST (create) things, we want to PUT (update) things, or we want to DELETE things.</p>
				<p>If we are going to be honest, web development is literally just doing those 4 things for things tied to a relational database. Sure, some complications come from security and complex relationships in the databse. However, browsers, HTTP, and SQL take 99% of the weight off our shoulders.</p>

				<h2>IP and TCP</h2>
				<p>Lets rush through IP and TCP because it's like trying to study binary. Sure, we could just study 0 and 1 or we could go down into the hardware that makes it possible. Lets just stick with 0 and 1.</p>

				<h2>Ruby on Rails: Making the requests</h2>
				<p>Okay, lets make a leap. We now know that we just have 4 ways to interact with data in the database. How does Ruby on Rails handle an HTTP request and translate that into 1 of the 4 interactions?</p>
				<p>Again, I'm going to approach this from the web developer viewpoint (which coincides with the server viewpoint).</p>
				<p>Lets follow a GET request through the HTTP system from client (you) to server (the website).</p>
				<p><b>Starting from the client:</b></p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Request</dt>
					<dd>GET https://domain.com/hello</dd>
					<dt>Server gets kicked into action</dt>
					<dd>Apache or NGINX makes some decisions</dd>
					<dt></dt>
				</dl>

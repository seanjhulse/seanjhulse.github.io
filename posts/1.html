				<h1>Graphs... what are they?</h1>
				<p>Graphs are like cities and roads. They are people and friendships. They are websites and routers.</p>
				<p>Graphs are almost always the last data structure you get to in your classes. But they are probably the easiest to understand because they don't have as many rules. Unlike a Linked List which is rigidly structured or a B Tree which has a coplex relationship with parents and children, the Graph is just a beautiful mess. It doesn't care if a single node has a thousand connections or no connections.</p>
				<p>All that being said, humans like order and we also like names. So, we've grouped graphs into various things: connected, directed, undirected, etc. Talking about Graphs is complicated. Traversing them can be complicated. But you figure that out in class. I'll I'm going to do is describe the graph behind these words.</p>

				<h2>Node</h2>
				<pre>
class Node {
	constructor() {
		this.neighbors = [];
	}
}
				</pre>
				<p>The Node class in a Graph is just an array of other nodes of which it's connected. Which means the graph is just:</p>
				<h2>Graph</h2>
				<pre>
class Graph {
	constructor() {
		this.nodes = []
	}
}
				</pre>
				<p>Graphs are just a list of nodes. And nodes are just a list of nodes. Technically, that's all you need and that's pretty much all I've constructed in the background.</p>

				<h2>What about Physics?</h2>
				<p>I built some basic physics to help this Graph feel alive. I gave them seom basic vectors, an x and y vector. Every frame, I just update their positions based on that vector. In order to keep them inside the frame I added a check to see if the x, y position of the Node will be outside the client window. If it is, I just "reflect" the Node off the wall. It's actually really easy to reflect the Node. You just check to see if it hit an X boundary (the bottom or top) or a Y boundary (the left or right). Then, you flip the sign of the x or y vector depending on which wall it hit.</p>
				<h2>Why is your solution so janky?</h2>
				<p>As a challenge, I decided to build this without canvas. Canvas is HTML's way of helping developers draw (hence the name). I chose to use raw "div" elements and style them in pure CSS. While that was more interesting, it's significantly less efficient to work with. But it has the added benefit of native DOM interactivity. Now my Graph is extensible for any standard user interactivity like <i>click</i>, <i>mouseover</i>, <i>keypress</i>, etc...</p>
